  A lot of Parliamentary debates have gone online due to the pandemic. It requires us to use multiple technologies, and often times not every participant is well-versed with every technology. Most organising committees will require to publish some sort of tech-guide for their participants. 

  This tech-guide is a template for organising committees using zoom+discord as their platform for hosting debates. Feel free to use this template *after changing the logos, links, etc.*

## How to make changes

The whole point of creating a tech-guide like this is that it is highly dynamic. PDFs need to be generated over and over if you have to change anything. A simple webpage like this allows you to:
* Modify links as and when you wish
* Create different zoom calls and update links
* Modify/evaluate policy changes as and when required
* Have complete control over how your tech guide looks.

Steps:
* Make changes to the index.md file as required
* Commit and push the code on to your github profile
* Setting up github pages can help you circulate the tech-guide in a convenient way. <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/pages/">Link</a> on how to set up github page
